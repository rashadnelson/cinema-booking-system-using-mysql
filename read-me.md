#CINEMA BOOKING SYSTEM USING MYSQL (READ ME FILE)
___

**This is a SQL project using MySQL Workbench, creating a "Cinema Booking System" where there's multiple data files available for connection and analysis work using SQL**

**The purpose of this project is to display my skills in SQL and related tools**.

**This project contains the following files:**

* The main SQL file - "cinema_booking_system.sql".  This file contains all the SQL code in an easy to follow format.  
* The Read Me file - "read-me.md" composed of this content. 
* Customer names and email address info file - "sql-customers-data.rtf".
* List of 2022 films being shown at theater - "sql-films-data.rtf".
* Theater rooms named after famous / notable film directors - "sql-films-data.rtf". 
* Dates and times of film screenings - "sql-screenings-data.rtf". 
* Seats available for reservation and purchase - "sql-seats-data.rtf".


**Step 1** - open each Rich Text Format (.rtf) file to briefly review the multiple data sets available.  Notice how the data already includes SQL syntax for easy insertion.  

**Step 2** - install the MySQL server, followed by MySQL Workbench.  For detailed installation instructions, please refer to any number of brief tutorials that can be found YouTube.

**Step 3** - open MySQL Workbench and then open file "cinema_booking_system.sql".  Please refer to multiple sources online on how to navigate MySQL Workbench.

**Step 4** - that's pretty much it.  Thank you so much for reviewing project in SQL.
